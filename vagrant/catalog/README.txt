Project Overview
This is an application that provides a list of items within a
variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and
authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit
and delete their own items.

Why This Project?
Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing
features and utilities to their users; but deep down,
itâ€™s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data.
This project combines the knowledge of building dynamic
websites with persistent data storage to create a web application
that provides a compelling service to the users.

This project demonstrates how to develop a RESTful web application using the
Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication.
and then show how to properly use the various HTTP methods available and how
these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
